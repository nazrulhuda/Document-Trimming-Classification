# Making a Classification to trim unimportant pages from a document

To make the dataset, we need a xlxs file that contains the file name and the important pages.
We download the important page numbers and split the pages into important and no important pages.
Then we make a ML algorithm and train it.
After the training, we can predict if a page is important or non important
